 Project details:
  In this project I cleaned up the source code for the landing page for Horiseon. I added semantic elements to help with organization and search engine optimization. I consolidated multiple CSS rules because they were breaking the "don't repeat yourself" rule. I fixed a link in the navbar, and reassigned class names to help with the CSS consolidation.
